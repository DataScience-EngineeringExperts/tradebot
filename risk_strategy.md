# Risk Management for Trading Portfolio

This code implements a comprehensive risk management system for a trading portfolio, specifically designed for managing positions in cryptocurrencies, commodities, equities, and options. The core functionality is encapsulated within the `RiskManagement` class, which utilizes the Alpaca Trade API and Alpha Vantage API to fetch market data and execute trades.

## Key Components

1. **Risk Parameter Loading**: The code loads risk parameters from a JSON file (`risk_params.json`). These parameters define various limits and thresholds for managing risk, such as maximum position size, maximum portfolio size, maximum drawdown, and maximum risk per trade.

2. **Portfolio Management**: The `PortfolioManager` class is responsible for managing the portfolio assets, including adding, updating, and calculating the value of assets.

3. **Portfolio Rebalancing**: The `RiskManagement` class implements a rebalancing strategy based on predefined target allocations for different asset classes (options, crypto, equities). The `rebalance_portfolio` method calculates the current allocation and buys or sells assets to align with the target allocation.

4. **Trade Validation**: The `validate_trade` method performs comprehensive validation checks before executing a trade. It considers factors such as daily trade limits, maximum position size, available cash, and maximum equity allocation for different asset classes. This method ensures that trades comply with the defined risk parameters.

5. **Equity Allocation Calculation**: The `calculate_equity_allocation` method calculates the maximum permissible equity allocation for different asset classes (crypto, equities, options) based on the defined risk parameters.

6. **Portfolio Optimization**: The `optimize_portfolio` method implements a portfolio optimization strategy based on historical data and risk aversion. It calculates expected returns, covariance matrices, and determines the optimal quantities to purchase for each asset.

7. **Profit/Loss Reporting**: The `report_profit_and_loss` method calculates the overall profit or loss for the portfolio by fetching account data and portfolio history from the Alpaca API.

8. **Risk Parameter Adjustment**: The `update_risk_parameters` method dynamically adjusts the risk parameters based on the portfolio's performance (profit or loss). It increases or decreases the maximum position size and maximum portfolio size depending on the profit or loss.

9. **Drawdown Calculation**: The `calculate_drawdown` method calculates the drawdown for the portfolio, which is the percentage decline from the peak portfolio value.

10. **Options Management**: The code includes functionality for managing options positions, such as calculating position Greeks, monitoring options expiration, and closing expiring options based on trend analysis.

11. **Momentum Strategies**: The code implements momentum-based strategies, including generating momentum signals (`generate_momentum_signal`), executing profit-taking (`execute_profit_taking`), and stop-loss (`execute_stop_loss`) strategies.

12. **Portfolio Diversification**: The `enforce_diversification` method ensures that no single asset exceeds a certain percentage of the overall portfolio value, maintaining diversification.

13. **Price Fetching**: The code includes methods for fetching current prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, and options from various sources, including Alpha Vantage API and the Alpaca API.

14. **Account Monitoring**: The `monitor_account_status` and `monitor_positions` methods provide functionality for monitoring and reporting the account status and open positions.
